- 👋 Hi, I’m Vasil Chomakov (@vchomakov-qb), you can simply call me Vasko
- 👀 I’m interested in AI & algorithms
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Quickbase tech stack as a new team member (started March 2024)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything AI and how it could help Quickbase for better product adoption/retention
- 📫 You can reach me over Slack (vchomakov) or email (vchomakov@quickbase.com)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been working at VMware for 15 years before this job (staring as an Intern and leaving as a Staff Engineer).
